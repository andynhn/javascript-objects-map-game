    <p>Use the console to make the player move "north", "south", "east", or "west" (e.g. move('north'))</p>
    <p>Type "player.location" to show player's current location on the map.</p>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <p>Deliver the honey to the appropriate home. The location is already listed in your console.</p>
    <p>Pick up the honey at the bees. To pick up, call the pickUp() function while at the bees location.</p>
    <p>To drop off the honey, call the drop() function while at the home that needs the honey.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
