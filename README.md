# javascript-objects-map-game
Game where players use the browser's console to traverse a map of javascript objects and accomplish a mission. Map was created using javascript objects that point to each other. User can make the "player" object move by changing its pointer ('north, 'south', 'east', and 'west'). Appropriate messages are logged to the console based on user input.
